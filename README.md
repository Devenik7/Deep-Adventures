# Deep Adventures

A hobby project of mine while I was in the intermediate stage of learning UNITY.

The protagonist is the character DEEP from the game "Little Fighter" by Marti Wong.

The sprites and sounds are not my property.

I used the sprites mostly from Little Fighter (game) and the sounds from Little Fighter and music from Shovel Knight.

The entire code and patterns is by me.

<i><b>To try it out - Download the build file and run the exe file inside on Windows PC.<b><i>

I love feedback. I'm almost a beginner-intermediate, so go easy on me.
